# VHDL Counter Overflow Bug
This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in VHDL code: improper handling of counter overflow.
The `counter` entity is designed to count from 0 to 15. However, the original code has a potential issue where the `internal_count` signal is not properly handled when it reaches its maximum value (15).  The solution provided addresses this issue by explicitly handling the overflow condition and ensuring correct behavior.
## Bug Description:
The original VHDL code lacks an explicit assignment to `internal_count` when the counter reaches 15 and the clock rises.  Although it resets to 0, the behavior in a synthesis tool may be unexpected or even generate a synthesis warning or error, especially in more complex scenarios.
## Solution:
The solution provides a more robust implementation that handles the counter overflow explicitly and avoids undefined behavior.  It assigns a specific value to the signal in the overflow condition, ensuring predictable and reliable results.
